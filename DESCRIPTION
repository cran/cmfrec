Description: Collective matrix factorization (a.k.a. multi-view or multi-way factorization,
	Singh, Gordon, (2008) <doi:10.1145/1401890.1401969>) tries to approximate a matrix 'X' as the
	product of two low-dimensional matrices aided with secondary information matrices about rows
	and/or columns of 'X' which are also factorized using the same latent components.
	The intended usage is for recommender systems, dimensionality reduction, and missing value imputation.
	Implements extensions of the original model (Cortes, (2018) <arXiv:1809.00366>) and can produce
	different factorizations such as the weighted 'implicit-feedback' model (Hu, Koren, Volinsky,
	(2008) <doi:10.1109/ICDM.2008.22>) or the enhanced model with 'implicit features' (Rendle, Zhang,
	Koren, (2019) <arXiv:1905.01395>), with or without side information. Can use gradient-based
	procedures or alternating-least squares procedures (Koren, Bell, Volinsky, (2009)
	<doi:10.1109/MC.2009.263>), with either a Cholesky solver, a faster conjugate gradient solver
	(Takacs, Pilaszy, Tikk, (2011) <doi:10.1145/2043932.2043987>), or a non-negative
	coordinate descent solver (Franc, Hlavac, Navara, (2005) <doi:10.1007/11556121_50>),
	providing efficient methods for sparse and dense data, and mixtures thereof.
	Offers alternative most-popular and content-based models, and implements functionality
	for cold-start recommendations and imputation of 2D data.
